Neurodivergence is the state of being neurodivergent, this is when someone thinks, communicates, and/or learns differently and significantly from the predominant population. Autism, ADHD and dyslexia are all forms of neurodivergence because the brain is wired a different way.

Dyslexia is a learning disorder characterized by difficulties with accurate and fluent word recognition, spelling, and decoding abilities. Individuals with dyslexia may struggle with reading comprehension, writing, and phonological processing. It's essential to recognize that dyslexia is not indicative of intelligence; many individuals with dyslexia possess above-average intellectual abilities and strengths in other areas, such as creativity, problem-solving, and visual thinking.

In our investigation, we worked closely with a student diagnosed with dyslexia who faced challenges with traditional text-based learning materials. Despite possessing strong cognitive abilities and a keen interest in the subject matter, the student struggled with processing written information efficiently and retaining key concepts. Recognizing the\\ importance of addressing these challenges, we sought to identify alternative approaches that would cater to the student's strengths and learning preferences.

\textbf{Challenges Faced by Students with Dyslexia in Higher Education:}

Transitioning to higher education can be daunting for students with dyslexia due to the increased academic demands, complex reading materials, and writing-intensive assignments. Some common challenges faced by these students include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Reading Complex Texts: College-level textbooks and academic articles often contain dense, technical language and complex concepts, which can pose significant challenges for students with dyslexia.

\item Writing Assignments: Writing essays, research papers, and reports requires strong literacy skills, including spelling, grammar, and sentence structure, areas in which students with dyslexia may struggle.

\item Time Management: Students with dyslexia may require additional time to complete reading assignments, write papers, and study for exams due to the time-intensive nature of reading and writing tasks.

\item Note-Taking: Taking comprehensive notes during lectures can be challenging for students with dyslexia, particularly if they struggle with handwriting or spelling.

\item Exam Accommodations: Standardized exams and timed tests may not accurately assess the knowledge and abilities of students with dyslexia, necessitating accommodations such as extended time, alternative formats, or assistive technology.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Choosing Visual Presentation of Material:}

After careful consideration and consultation with the student, we determined that a more visual presentation of learning materials would be beneficial. Visual learning strategies leverage images, diagrams, charts, and other visual aids to convey information, making abstract concepts more tangible and facilitating comprehension. By incorporating visual elements into course materials and instructional activities, we aimed to provide the student with alternative pathways to understanding complex concepts and enhancing learning outcomes.

\textbf{Implementation of Visual Learning Strategies:}

The implementation of visual learning strategies involved several key components:

\begin{itemize}
\item Visual Aids in Lectures: During lectures, instructors utilized visual aids such as slideshows, diagrams, and multimedia presentations to supplement verbal explanations. Visuals were carefully designed to illustrate key points, reinforce concepts, and provide context, thereby enhancing the student's understanding and engagement.

\item Visual Text Adaptations: Course materials, including textbooks, readings, and handouts, were adapted to include more visual elements such as illustrations, infographics, and annotated diagrams. Visual text adaptations were designed to break down information into digestible chunks, improve readability, and support comprehension for students with dyslexia.

\item Interactive Learning Activities: Incorporating interactive learning activities such as group discussions, collaborative projects, and hands-on exercises provided the student with opportunities to engage with course content in a dynamic and multisensory manner. Interactive activities encouraged active participation, fostered critical thinking skills, and facilitated deeper understanding of subject matter.

\item Access to Visual Technology Tools: The student was provided with access to visual technology tools and assistive technologies designed to support visual learning, such as mind mapping software, graphic organizers, and digital drawing applications. These tools empowered the student to create visual representations of concepts, organize information spatially, and express ideas creatively.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Conclusion}:

By embracing visual learning as a means of enhancing accessibility and inclusivity, educators can empower neurodivergent students to overcome learning barriers and achieve academic success. Through thoughtful implementation of visual-based educational strategies, colleges and universities can create learning environments that cater to the diverse needs of all learners, fostering a culture of equity, diversity, and inclusion in higher education.
